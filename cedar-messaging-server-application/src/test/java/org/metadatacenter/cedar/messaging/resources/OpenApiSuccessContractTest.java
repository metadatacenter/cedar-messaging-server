/**
 * Holds this service's committed OpenAPI document to the estate's rule that a success payload is
 * described rather than merely acknowledged.
 *
 * <p>Only three of the eleven spec-shipping services verified their committed document at all, and
 * none of them checked the success side. A 2xx with no schema, a dangling reference, an empty schema
 * and a JSON body typed as a bare string all leave a client generator with nothing to work from, and
 * each is cheap to reintroduce by adding a route and forgetting an annotation.</p>
 *
 * <p>The one write listed as bodiless takes no body: the command acts on the caller's own
 * messages and names nothing.</p>
